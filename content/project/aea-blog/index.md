The [AEA RCT Regsitry Ten-Year Anniverasy Blog](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/blog/1-26-24/celebrating-decade-aea-rct-registry), featured on the [World Bank Blogs](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/impactevaluations/weekly-links-february-16-7000-rcts-better-bar-graphs-dating-apps-and-platform), delves into the evolution of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) over a decade through an analysis of metadata from the AEA RCT Registry. It explores trends in thematic focus, geographic representation, and funding patterns, uncovering shifts in research priorities. Notably, I identified a marked increase in the use of “Behavior” as a sector tag over the past four years, reflecting growing interest in behavioral interventions and their impact. This analysis underscores the registry's role in fostering transparency and collaboration while revealing how research priorities adapt to emerging global challenges, offering a lens into the trajectory of evidence-based policymaking.
