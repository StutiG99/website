At J-PAL, I manage the AEA RCT Registry, enhancing research transparency and reproducibility. Additionally, I support scholars programs at J-PAL's regional offices in South Asia, Africa, and MENA to empower local researchers, diversifying the research pipeline. At J-PAL, I have also utilized Generative AI to streamline and automate internal processes. Previously, at Pratham Education Foundation, I developed monitoring and evaluation frameworks to assess educational interventions across multiple Indian states during COVID-19 school closures.
