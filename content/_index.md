description: With a B.A. in Quantitative Economics and a minor in Statistics and Data Science from Smith College, through my work in the development sector, I have built a strong foundation in leveraging data to inform policy and practice. My career has spanned roles in research, monitoring, and program evaluation, working across global and grassroots organizations. I have consistently balanced high-level analytical rigor with on-the-ground implementation, engaging with diverse stakeholders to address complex challenges. This trajectory reflects a commitment to using data and productive collaborations to drive impactful and equitable solutions in the development sector.
