description: "With a degree in Quantitative Economics and Statistics & Data Science, I have built a strong foundation in leveraging data to inform policy and practice. My career spans roles in research, monitoring, and program evaluation across global and grassroots organizations. At J-PAL, I manage the AEA RCT Registry, enhancing research transparency and reproducibility. Additionally, I support scholars programs at J-PALs regional offices in South Asia, Africa, and MENA to empower local researchers, diversifying the research pipeline. At J-PAL, I have also utilized Generative AI to streamline and automate internal processes. Previously, at Pratham Education Foundation, I developed monitoring and evaluation frameworks to assess educational interventions across multiple Indian states during COVID-19 school closures. \n\n Through these roles, I have collaborated directly with diverse stakeholders—including beneficiaries, governments, bureaucrats, academics, and NGOs—developing the ability to convene and translate ideas across groups, facilitating stakeholder alignment. I am dedicated to leveraging technology and digital public infrastructure to transform programs and their delivery, aiming to drive impactful and equitable solutions in the development sector."
